Cloud Shadows solves the challenge of rendering convincing cloud shapes, animating the clouds over time, positioning the clouds to follow your camera or player, and dithering the cloud shapes so that they offer transparency support.

Cloud Shadows is configurable, with options for the cloud speed, cloud orientation, cloud dithering and transparency, cloud scale and texture, along with other options.

This package is designed to make it easy to get good results without retooling your project or redesigning your source art assets.

Cloud Shadows just works regardless of your scene content. When you change your scene - such a moving a character, changing a material, or moving the camera - this Cloud Shadows shader continues working normally and will render according to the options you provide in the component.

Cloud Shadows works in real time across all genres including casual games, FPS, third person, side-scroller, top down, and RTS.

Cloud Shadows is fully integrated withÂ Unity's shadow system, so it works well with other Unity tools and assets.
