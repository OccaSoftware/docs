Fireworks
===============================

Fireworks is a simple firework visual effect package for Unity HDRP and URP using Visual Effect Graph.

Fireworks includes a random visual effect object spawner as well as a utility that picks a random audio effect to play from a user-provided list when the firework explodes.

Fireworks includes one Visual Effect Graph asset, 4 example Fireworks made with this Graph, and 5 Sound Effects.

Fireworks works in real time across all genres including casual games, FPS, third person, side-scroller, top down, and RTS.

Fireworks works well with other Unity tools and assets.
