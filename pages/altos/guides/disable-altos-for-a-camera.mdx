Disable Altos for a Specific Camera
============================

## Overview

Altos may conflict with other assets that create and use cameras.
The best way to resolve this is to assign those cameras to a different Renderer that uses a slimmed-down set of Renderer Features.
If that is not possible, you can disable Altos on a specific camera using the included DiableAltosRendering.cs component.

Setup Steps
-----------

### Step 1

Identify the camera that is causing the issues. Third-party assets may generate and manage cameras by script during runtime.

### Step 2

Add the DisableAltosRendering.cs component to that camera. If a third-party asset generates and manages the camera by script, modify the script.

```
using OccaSoftware.Altos.Runtime

// ...

void Update()
{
    //...
    camera.AddComponent<DisableAltosRendering>();
}

```

### Step 3

Confirm that you have added the component to the camera.

### Step 4

Confirm that the rendering issue is gone.
