# Weather System

Altos enables you to set precipitation and weather states using Weather Manager components.

To preview the weather map, click Window > OccaSoftware > Altos > Cloudmap Preview

## Add a Weather State

1. Create a new Game Object
1. Click Add Component > OccaSoftware > Altos > Weather Manager

## Configure the Weather State

1. Position the Weather State on the XZ plane where you want to originate the weather state from.
1. Set the Precipitation Intensity. 1 = Rain. 0 = No Rain.
1. Set the Radius of the Weather State.

## Integrate VFX

Altos VFX are automatically integrated with the weather system using the `WeatherEffect` class.

You can use the WeatherEffect component or roll your own.

### Using the WeatherEffect Component (Recommended)

To integrate your own VFX with the weather system, add a `altos_PrecipitationAmount` property to your Visual Effect asset, then use the `WeatherEffect` component to set it.
