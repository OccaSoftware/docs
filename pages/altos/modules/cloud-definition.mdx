# Cloud Definition

Altos includes a system for rendering physically based volumetric and 2D clouds in real time in Unity.

## Cloud Definition Overview

The cloud definition comprises three parts: Common Configuration, Low Altitude Configuration, and High Altitude Configuration.

### Common

Common Configuration lets you set general rendering, lighting, atmosphere, and shadow parameters.

### Low Altitude

Low Altitude Configuration lets you set up the Modeling, Lighting, Weather, and Cloud Shape parameters for low-altitude clouds. These are the big, fluffy ones close to the ground.

### High Altitude

High Altitude Configuration lets you set up the Density, Cloud Coverage, and input Textures for the high-altitude clouds. These are the high-up, thin, wispy ones.

## Cloud Shadows

Cloud Shadows is an experimental feature that supports dynamic, real-time cloud shadows using volumetric clouds.

By default, Altos will sample the cloud shadow map as a post-process. Unfortunately, this will apply shadows to emissive objects, lights, unlit materials, etc.

To get physically-based results, sample from the cloud shadow texture. Use the CloudShadows.hlsl include file and call the GetCloudShadowAttenuation method, passing in the World Space position of the fragment you'd like to shade.

## Cloud Fly-Through

You have two options for how Altos handles the Z Distance when rendering clouds. The clouds can either (1) respect depth-writing geometry and occlude objects behind them or (2) ignore depth-writing geometry and render as part of the skybox.

If you want volumetric clouds to render as part of the skybox, set the Rendering Mode to Background Only Clouds.

If you want volumetric clouds to render as part of the scene, set the Rendering Mode to Render In Front of Opaque Geometry.

You cannot have a mix of modes (1) and (2) where you respect some depth-writing geometry and ignore others.

## Rendering Off-Screen Clouds

Altos does not render off-screen clouds, but Altos volumetric clouds do account for lighting and shadows from off-screen clouds.
