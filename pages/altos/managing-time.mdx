# Managing time

## Overview

The Sky Definition controls the time options for your project. To set the start time when you hit play, configure the `Initial Time`. To set the current time during gameplay, set the `Current Time`.

Altos moves the time forward each frame. To set the rate of time, configure the `Day-Night Cycle Duration`. This value is set in hours. To make your day-night cycle take 1 real-world hour, set the day-night cycle duration to a value of 1.

## API

All time properties and methods are in the Sky Definition. To access the Sky Definition, get a reference to the Sky Director, then access the Sky Definition.

```cs
SkyDefinition skyDefinition = AltosSkyDirector.Instance.skyDefinition;
```

## Getting the time

To get the current day time, call `CurrentTime`, `CurrentTime01`, or `CurrentDay` getter like

```cs
float currentTime = AltosSkyDirector.Instance.skyDefinition.CurrentTime;
float currentTime01 = AltosSkyDirector.Instance.skyDefinition.CurrentTime01;
int currentDay = AltosSkyDirector.Instance.skyDefinition.CurrentDay;
```

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents the current in-game time. A function of the initial time of day and the day-night cycle duration.
/// <br>Range: [0, 24]</br>
/// </summary>
public float CurrentTime
{
    get => timeSystem % 24;
}

/// <summary>
/// Represents the current in-game time as a percentage between 0 and 1.
/// </summary>
public float CurrentTime01
{
    get => CurrentTime / 24f;
}

/// <summary>
/// Represents the number of 24-hour periods (in Altos time) elapsed from a timeSystem value of 0.
/// </summary>
public int CurrentDay
{
    get => (int)timeSystem / 24;
}
```

## Setting the time

To set the current time, call `SetSystemTime` or `SetDayAndTime`.

To set the time to 1 day and 12 hours, call these methods like this:

```cs
AltosSkyDirector.Instance.skyDefinition.SetSystemTime(36f);
AltosSkyDirector.Instance.skyDefinition.SetDayAndTime(1, 12f);
```

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Sets the system time directly. The system time is continuous and includes the day count (i.e., 1 day + 12h = 36).
/// </summary>
public void SetSystemTime(float timeSystem)
{
    this.timeSystem = timeSystem;
    UpdatePeriod();
    UpdateSky();
}

/// <summary>
/// Sets the current day and time of day directly. Time will be wrapped in the range [0, 24]. Day has a min value of 0.
/// </summary>
public void SetDayAndTime(int day, float time)
{
    timeSystem = (Mathf.Max(0, day) * 24) + (time % 24);
    UpdatePeriod();
    UpdateSky();
}
```
