# Cloud Shadows

Altos includes a cloud shadow rendering system as well. You can enable it from the Cloud definition.

## Compatibility with shaders

Cloud Shadows don't write to Unity's shadowmap since it doesn't support transparency, which is really important for good-looking cloud shadows.

But, you can integrate cloud shadows with transparent objects! This is easiest when using custom shaders or unlit shader graphs. Lit shader graphs don't work very well since you don't have a way to override the lighting.

### Where to find the implementation

Go to Altos/ShaderLibrary/CloudShadows.hlsl for function implementations

### Custom Shader

In your includes, include the CloudShadow file:

```hlsl
# include "Packages/com.occasoftware.altos/ShaderLibrary/CloudShadows.hlsl"
```

In your shader, get the cloud shadow attenuation:

```hlsl
float cloudShadowAttenuation = GetCloudShadowAttenuation(postionWS);
```

Use the cloud shadows to attenuate your lighting, e.g.,

```hlsl
float lightAttenuation = light.shadowAttenuation * cloudShadowAttenuation
```

### Shader Graph

Use the included GetCloudShadows subgraph
