# Sky Director

The sky director is the core of an Altos configuration.

## How to add

Add this component to your project with Add Component > OccaSoftware > Altos > Altos Sky Director.

## Config files

The sky director includes slots for your four major config files.

1. [Sky](./modules/sky-definition)
1. [Atmosphere](./modules/atmosphere-definition)
1. [Stars](./modules/star-definition)
1. [Clouds](./modules/cloud-definition)

Config files make it easy to share common settings between different scenes.

More about config files in /modules section.

## Data file

The sky director also includes a data file. This file contains .shader files and other resources that Altos needs to run properly.

## Get the current sky director

When a sky director is enabled, it sets a global static variable, `AltosSkyDirector.Instance`. Reference this variable to get the currently active sky director.

```cs
void Update()
{
    AltosSkyDirector skyDirector = AltosSkyDirector.Instance;
}
```
