# Visual Effects

Altos includes ambient visual effects.

To render transparent materials behind clouds, see the [pre-transparency pass section of our getting started doc](/altos/getting-started#set-up-your-pre-transparency-pass).


* Auroras
* Shooting Stars
* Comets
* Rain
* Snow
* Lightning

This section will give an overview on usage.

## Rain and Snow

Rain and Snow are weather effects.

Weather Effects are integrated with the Altos precipitation system. When it rains, the `WeatherEffect` component will automatically set the altos_PrecipitationAmount property in the Visual Effect.

Weather Effects are integrated with the Wind Zone system. When you have an Altos Wind Zone enabled, the Weather Effect will receive the wind.

## Auroras

Auroras are placeable meshes. They are integrated with the Altos day-night cycle.

## Comets and Shooting Stars

Comets and Shooting Stars are world-space VFX. They are integrated with the Altos day-night cycle. Position and configure them like any Visual Effect graph asset.

## Lightning

Lighting is a world-space VFX, but it is integrated with the Altos cloud system. When a lightning effect is spawned, the lightning VFX also illuminates the clouds. This uses the `VFX Lightning Effect Spawner` system.

Otherwise, configure the lightning like any other Visual Effect graph asset.
