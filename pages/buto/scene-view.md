# Rendering in Scene View

## Overview

Buto renders in scene view.

This makes it easy for you to view and customize the fog while in the editor and while working in scene view.

## Enabling Buto in Scene View

Buto only renders in Scene View when the Scene View Shading mode is set to Shaded, when the Fog toggle is enabled, and when the Post Processing toggle is enabled. If any of these toggles are disabled or if you are rendering the Scene View in an alternative view mode (e.g., Wireframe), then Buto will not render in Scene View.
