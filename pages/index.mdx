# Introduction

## About

[OccaSoftware] develops a suite of tools and assets for [Unity].

## Compatibility

We have standard compatibility targets for all of our tools.

### Unity Versions

Our assets work with the [latest Unity LTS release](https://unity.com/releases/lts-vs-tech-stream).

We do not officially support Unity Tech Stream releases. Unity Tech releases are pre-LTS preview releases from Unity. Our assets may work, but we can't provide support and don't guarantee that every feature will work.

### Render Pipelines

We design our assets for Universal Render Pipeline.

We do not officially support Built-In Render Pipeline or High Definition Render Pipeline. Our assets may work, but we can't provide support and don't guarantee that every feature will work.

### Platforms

Our assets have various technical requirements. Some assets will work on lower-end hardware. In general, our assets support all platforms that support Geometry Shaders and Compute Shaders.
