# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through the basics of installing an OccaSoftware package using Unity.

OccaSoftware serves two types of assets: 'asset' packages and 'package' packages.

- You must import 'assets' to your /Assets/ folder.
- You must import 'packages' to your /Packages/ folder.

## Get Started with Assets

You will use your file browser to load OccaSoftware assets from a .zip file which you can download from the dashboard.

1. Download the asset .zip file from the dashboard
2. Extract the .zip contents
3. Drag the folder into your /Assets/ directory

## Get Started with Packages

You will use the Unity Package Manager to load OccaSoftware packages from our Git repositories, which are hosted on Github.

In this example, we will install Ninja - a lightweight performance profiler.

### Install Git and Git LFS

- Install the [Git client](https://git-scm.com/) (minimum version 2.14.0).
- Install the [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) client.

### Install the Package

1. Open the Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)
2. Open the Add menu in the Package Manager's toolbar.
3. Select Add package from git URL from the add menu. A text box and an Add button appear.
4. Enter the Git URL (`https://github.com/OccaSoftware/ninja.git`) and click Add.

If Unity was able to install the package successfully, the package now appears in the package list with the label.

### Specify a package version

To declare a specific package version that you want the Package Manager to clone, add the revision prefixed by the number sign (#) at the end of the URL:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.occasoftware.ninja": "https://github.com/OccaSoftware/ninja.git#1.1.0",
  }
}
```

### Troubleshoot

 If Unity wasn’t able to install the package, the Unity Console will display an error message.

- No ‘git’ executable was found
- git-lfs: command not found
- Repository not found
- Could not read Username: terminal prompts disabled
