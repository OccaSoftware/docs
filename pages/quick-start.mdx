# Quick Start

This guide will describe how to install an OccaSoftware product in Unity.

Unity supports two types of resources:

- [Assets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetWorkflow.html)
- [Packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PackagesList.html)

Assets are typically images, models, or audio files; Packages are typically code plug-ins.

OccaSoftware publishes both Assets and Packages. Unity projects are split in two folders: Assets and Packages. You must import Assets and Packages to the corresponding folder in your Unity project.

- Import Assets to your /Assets/ folder.
- Import Packages to your /Packages/ folder.

## Get Started with Assets

This section details how to download and import an Asset from OccaSoftware.

1. Identify the Asset you want in the Dashboard.
2. Click the Download button.
3. Extract the zip file.
4. Import the folder to your /Assets/ directory.

## Get Started with Packages

This section details how to download and import a Package from OccaSoftware.

You will use the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) to load OccaSoftware packages from our Git repositories. (We host our Git repositories on [Github](https://github.com/occasoftware).)

In this example, you will install Ninja. Ninja is a lightweight performance profiling widget. As an overview, you will need to take the following steps:

1. Install Git and Git LFS.
2. Install the Package.

### 1. Install Git and Git LFS

- Install the [Git client](https://git-scm.com/) (minimum version 2.14.0).
- Install the [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) client.

### 2. Install the Package

1. Open the Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)
2. Open the Add menu in the Package Manager's toolbar.
3. Select Add package from git URL from the add menu. A text box and an Add button appear.
4. Enter the Git URL (`https://github.com/OccaSoftware/ninja.git`) and click Add.

If Unity was able to install the package successfully, the package now appears in the package list with the label.

### Specify a package version

To declare a specific package version that you want the Package Manager to clone, add the revision prefixed by the number sign (#) at the end of the URL:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.occasoftware.ninja": "https://github.com/OccaSoftware/ninja.git#1.1.0",
  }
}
```

### Troubleshoot

 If Unity wasn’t able to install the package, the Unity Console will display an error message.

- No ‘git’ executable was found
- git-lfs: command not found
- Repository not found
- Could not read Username: terminal prompts disabled
