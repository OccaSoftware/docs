## Why use Toon Kit 2

Toon Kit 2 solves the challenge of writing your own toon lighting model and integrating that toon lighting model with basic Unity features like shadows and additional lights.

## Features

- Supports opaque, transparent, and alpha clip materials.
- Uses a proprietary toon lighting model that maximizes the quality of the toon lighting results.
- Made with a combination of Shader Graph, Sub Graphs, and Custom Function Nodes so that you can edit the source shader without needing to learn to code shaders.
- Support for front-face, back-face, and both-sided rendering.
- Depth test and depth write options
- Compatible with SSAO

Toon Kit 2 offers detailed control over the specific lighting features that you use from our toon lighting model, so you have complete control over the final look for your project.
