# Introduction

Get a technical overview of the Ballistics package.

## Namespaces

Ballistics is organized into three namespaces:

```cs
OccaSoftware.Ballistics.Runtime
OccaSoftware.Ballistics.Editor
OccaSoftware.Ballistics.Demo
```

`Runtime` is the primary namespace that you will interact with.
You can reference the Demo namespace to understand usage patterns.
You likely wonâ€™t need to interact with the Editor namespace.

## Major Data Types

Ballistics includes three data types. You should familiarize yourself with them.

```cs
Projectile
Environment
SimulationConfig
```

Each one contains some information about how the simulation should work.

You can create these ahead of time as a Scriptable Object asset. You can also create or modify them during gameplay.

### Projectile

Projectile describes a ballistics projectile.
These characteristics include the following:

- Origin
- Direction
- Muzzle Velocity
- Initial Kinetic Energy
- Mass,
- etc.

When you instantiate a projectile, you should call Projectile.SetOriginAndDirection(Vector3 origin, Vector3 direction) to initialize these fields before passing the Projectile to the simulation.

Some of these characteristics are calculated automatically (e.g., Initial Kinetic Energy), but most are expected as inputs.

### Environment

Environment describes a set of Environment Conditions.
These characteristics include:

- Gravity
- Atmospheric Pressure
- Humidity
- Temperature
- Air Density

Some of these characteristics are calculated automatically (e.g., Air Density). OThers are expected as inputs (e.g., Humidity, Temperature)

### SimulationConfig

SimulationConfig describes the nature of the simulation that should be executed,

These characteristics include:

- Maximum Simulation Distance
- Simulation Timestep
