## Structure

Altos consists of four main modules:

1. Sky Rendering and Time of Day
1. Volumetric Clouds
1. Stars
1. Atmospheric Fog

## Integration

Altos makes it easy to trigger gameplay events based on your time of day. It uses event providers (like Actions).

Altos works, regardless of your game's art style. We designed this sky package using physically-based principles. But, we also designed it to give you total control so that you can achieve the look you want.

Altos includes over one hundred unique texture assets. These include art assets like star and moon textures. It also includes built-in volumetric noise textures. You do not need to be an artist to use Altos.

Altos works in real time across all genres. Altos is a great fit for first-person and third-person 3D games. Altos also works well for Real-Time Strategy games or 2D Games.

Altos integrates well with other Unity packages. Altos also works well with other assets from the Unity Asset Store.
