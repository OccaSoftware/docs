# LSPP

LSPP is a fast post-process god ray effect. LSPP (short for Light Scattering Post Process) makes it extremely easy to add depth and detail to your scene with real-time light scattering. LSPP is a renderer feature and is integrated with the volume component system.

LSPP is configurable but straightforward. With fewer than 10 options, you don't need to read a book to learn how to use the asset. That being said, it offers sufficient options to make the volumetric lighting look the way you want. And, it offers performance-related controls so that you can meet your project's frame budgets.

## Compatibility

LSPP is compatible with Unity 2021.3 and higher. LSPP depends on the Universal Render Pipeline and is only compatible with that pipeline. LSPP has no other external dependencies.
