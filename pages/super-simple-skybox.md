Super Simple Skybox solves the problem of authoring a dynamic skybox shader with support for rendering a moon, procedural and texture-based stars, and seamless clouds, and integrating these features with an easy-to-use day-night cycle system.

Super Simple Skybox also makes it easy to dynamically adjust your scene based on time of day transitions with built-in callback actions on various events.

Super Simple Skybox works regardless of your game's art style. This asset is highly customizable, so you can achieve both realistic and stylized rendering without being forced to switch to a different system.

Super Simple Skybox includes dozens of art assets, so you don't need to author these yourself. It includes procedural cloud textures modeled on both procedural noise as well as real-world photographs. It also includes night sky textures from real-world photographs.

Super Simple Skybox was designed using Shader Graph so that you can easily change the shader without needing to learn to code shaders yourself.

Super Simple Skybox works in real time across all genres including casual games, FPS, third person, side-scroller, top down, and RTS.

Super Simple Skybox also works well with other Unity tools and assets, like timelines, sequences, animations, cinemachine, and more.
