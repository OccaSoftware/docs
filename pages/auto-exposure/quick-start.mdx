# Quick Start

Follow the steps in this section to install Auto Exposure in your project. Get started quickly with the progressive importance mask.

## Installing Auto Exposure

Auto Exposure is a paid package on the Unity Asset Store. You install Auto Exposure by licensing it on the Unity Asset Store, then importing it to your project like any other Unity Asset.

After you install Auto Exposure, a new *Auto Exposure*folder appears in the Packages, and a new Renderer Feature is available to your Universal Renderer Data.

Add the Auto Exposure Renderer Feature to your Universal Renderer so that your scriptable renderer has access to the Auto Exposure passes.

## Enabling Auto Exposure

Auto Exposure is designed to work with Unity URP's Volume Framework. You are expected to have some familiarity with using this framework.

In order to enable Auto Exposure, you need to create a new volume, then add Auto Exposure as an override to that volume.

The Auto Exposure override is disabled by default. To enable it, set the mode to On.

Auto Exposure is now working in your project.

## Configuring Auto Exposure

You can customize the settings for your Auto Exposure directly from the override.

If you have more than one local volume in your scene, Unity will automatically interpolate between the Auto Exposure settings for the local volumes.
